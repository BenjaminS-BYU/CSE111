# Benjamin Strong CSE111 September 2025
# Things I added or changed:
# Changed some magic numbers to named constants for clarity like EARTH_ACCELERATION_OF_GRAVITY and WATER_DYNAMIC_VISCOSITY
# Added a function to convert kilopascals to psi and used it in main, also added tests for it in the test file
# Added both psi and kPa to the final output for user convenience
# Also added some comments for clarity such as the function docstrings and comments in main and 
# the other functions for what they do
# Added some return value checks to ensure no negative values are returned inappropriately
