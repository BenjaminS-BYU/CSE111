# A good function is understandable by other programmers. One way to make a 
# function understandable is to write a documentation string at the top of the function 
# that describes the function, its parameters, and its return value. Another way to make a 
# function understandable is to write comments in the body of the function as needed.

# A good function performs a single task that the programmer can describe, 
# and the functionâ€™s name matches its task.

# A good function is relatively short, perhaps fewer than 20 lines of code.

# A good function has as few decision points (if statements and loops) as possible. 
# Too many decision points in a function make a function error prone and difficult to test.

# A good function is as reusable as possible. Functions that use parameters and 
# return a result are more reusable than functions that get input from a user and print results to a terminal window.
