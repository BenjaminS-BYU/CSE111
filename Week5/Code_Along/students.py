students.py
This module provides functionality to read student data from a CSV file, store it in a dictionary,
and allow lookup of student names by their ID numbers. It includes input sanitization to ensure
only valid numeric IDs are processed.
Functions:
    main():
        Entry point of the program. Reads student data from 'students.csv', prompts the user for an ID,
        sanitizes the input, and prints the corresponding student name or an error message.
    read_csv_file(filename):
        Reads a CSV file containing student IDs and names, skipping the header row, and populates
        the global student_dict with ID-name pairs.
    id_lookup(user_id, dic_name):
        Looks up a student name by ID in the provided dictionary. Returns the name if found,
        otherwise prints an error message and exits the program.
    remove_extras(u_input):
        Sanitizes user input by removing all non-digit characters using regular expressions,
        returning only the numeric portion of the input.
Global Variables:
    student_dict (dict): Stores student ID as keys and names as values.
