What is one program you wrote that you were particularly proud of during this course? Why were you proud? Explain.

    I am really proud of my final project becasue it was planned all by me and I took my time to make sure it worked as planned.
    I really love the feeling of knowing all the code in a project. I'm just really proud I was able to overcome the problems of 
    this project and I feel much much more confident in myself. I'm also proud that I could use this program in my daily life.




How might you use the skills you learned in this course in the future? This might include skills such as programming, problem-solving, debugging, etc.
    Definitely use this for freelancing and volenteer work. I'll be looking for real world experiences and help my family with making projects 
    they could use. I'm really excited to take what I learned into my daily life so I can make things I'm proud of.



Describe an experience from this class that has given you confidence that you can learn new programming skills in the future.
    Planning out the final project really solidified in my mind that I can do this. Before this I was always a little worried that I 
    couldn't plan out a big project, but man I can!. This also has given me the confidence to solve big probelms in my everyday life, Thank you.
